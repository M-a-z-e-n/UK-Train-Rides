## 🔄 Data Processing & Modeling  

### 🧹 **Data Cleaning**  
✔ Removed empty values in **Reason for Delay** column by setting "On Time" as default.  
✔ Verified **data types** to ensure smooth processing.  
✔ Managed **null values** in actual time for canceled journeys.  

### 🌟 **Star Schema Data Model**  
✅ **Fact Table:** `Transactions Fact` (Holds transactional data)  
✅ **Dimension Tables:**  
- `Dim Tickets` 🎫 (Ticket details)  
- `Dim Journeys` 🚆 (Journey details)  
- `Dim Status` 🚦 (Journey status & delays)  

---

## 📌 Power BI Relationships  
🔗 `Transactions Fact` → `Dim Tickets` *(1-to-Many)*  
🔗 `Transactions Fact` → `Dim Journeys` *(1-to-Many)*  
🔗 `Dim Journeys` → `Dim Status` *(1-to-Many)*

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures  

### 💰 **Sales & Revenue Metrics**  
📊 **Total Sales:**  
```DAX
SUM('Transactions Fact'[Price])
```  
🛒 **Transaction Count:**  
```DAX
COUNTROWS('Transactions Fact')
```  
🎟 **Revenue by Ticket Class:**  
```DAX
CALCULATE(SUM('Transactions Fact'[Price]), ALLEXCEPT('Dim Tickets', 'Dim Tickets'[Ticket Class]))
```  
🔄 **Running Total Sales:**  
```DAX
CALCULATE([Total Sales], 
    FILTER(ALLSELECTED('Transactions Fact'[Purchase Date]), 
    'Transactions Fact'[Purchase Date] <= MAX('Transactions Fact'[Purchase Date])))
```  

### 🚆 **Journey Performance Metrics**  
🚆 **Total Delayed Journeys:**  
```DAX
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Dim Status'), 'Dim Status'[Journey Status] = "Delayed")
```  
❌ **Total Cancelled Journeys:**  
```DAX
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Dim Status'), 'Dim Status'[Journey Status] = "Cancelled")
```  
💳 **Sales by Payment Method:**  
```DAX
CALCULATE(SUM('Transactions Fact'[Price]), ALLEXCEPT('Transactions Fact', 'Transactions Fact'[Payment Method]))
```
